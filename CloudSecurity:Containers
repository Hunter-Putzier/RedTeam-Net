#Containers

In cloud security when is it appropriate to use containers in cloud deployments an what are the security benefits of doing so?

  In cloud security it is appropriate to use containers when building or to provide a wall of defense to keep the public out. In project 1 I used containers
  to provide a more secure network environment. In doing so I made the environment only accessible by individuals on my personal networks that knew the direct path to
  take to get in. This was an appropriate use because it kept other individuals out and only made the project environment accessible by me. The security benefits I 
  expect out of using containers is to provide a wall of defense by pairing security rules to keep intruders out and accessing my environment. In project 1 I 
  configured my VM to run containers by using yaml code to download and configure docker. It did this by downloading docker.io, installing pip3, installing the 
  docker python module, downloading the container and then enabling the docker service. To verify the service was active and running I ran the code $!(sudo docker ps)
  in doing so it showed that the  docker container was up and running and then I ran $!(sudo docker attach docker_name) to remote into the container. In order to 
  achieve this same outcome without containers I would need to create more VMs on the network that are only accessible by eachother which is not cost effective or 
  efficient. However VMS provide a better use for bigger enterprise environments and helps them view their whole network in one place. It also enables them to 
  efficiently monitor internal security as well as enforce security and compliance.
